                            Research into Gameplay Programmer
                          </h3>
                          <p>Role of a Gameplay programmer <br>
                            A Gameplay programmer is the main person/ people behind the code for how the player will interact with the game, they are resposable for the mechnicals the player will have 
                            access to. The gameplay programmer is a vital role in the creation of the game 
                            <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">as their input will be the area that the player will be basing there opinion of the game on. <br> <br>
                              Job Description <br>
                              The job of a gameplay programmer will vary greatly. The job will depend on the size of the studio for example. if it was a job in a smaller studio the role will require
                              a more varied job, it is likely that it would involve work in area across the entire game and involvement in more than just gameplay programming. However if the role was
                              for a large studio it is likely that the work would be much more focused on a specific area or mechanic, this is due to the amount of people that a large studio can employ and therefore
                              can give people much more specific tasks. <br>
                              Another way the job will vary is how experienced the person looking for employment is, if they are a junior programmer it is likely that the workload would be smaller
                              and the complexity of the task that they do will be lower than an experienced employee. An experience programmer will likely take on a much larger workload or be tasked
                              with helping junior programmer if they are working on a similar system. The final role would be a senior programmer the workload for this role would be very high and
                              they would usually have to delegate work to groups of people and be responsible for how the game will play and the decisions in the gameplay that will have to be made. <br> <br>
                              Skills and Other Careers <br>
                              As a gameplay programmer the skills required will be much more than just having good knowledge in the coding languages. Despite this being an important skill,
                              it can be overshadowed by lack of other abilities. In a modern game studio, the communication ability of the employee is key as it is likely that you will be required
                              to work together with other employees on task or mechanics in a game. Another really important skill for an employee will be their problem solving skills if they person
                              is unable to work off their own intuition and solve problems themselves they will struggle to integrate into an environment where being able to quickly and efficient
                              work out issues is essential. Despite other skills being very important the base knowledge of coding language and the ability to learn new languages will be very important
                              the software and language used in the games industry is vast and having the base knowledge of multiple languages is important as companies will want employees who
                              can adapt quickly and they can support to become a good programmer for them. <br> <br>
                              Due to gameplay programming being a job which involves a large amount of coding, other job that would be visible is of course other area of the games industry the transition
                              would be quick and easy as the person would have very desirable skills especially if they have industry experience. Another career path could be most jobs within the IT
                              industry there is plenty of overlapping skills and having the knowledge of a gameplay programmer would make transition to this industry relatively easy. Due to demanding work
                              of a gameplay programmer there is may routes into other industries and having the skills from the games industry will provide a good platform to move to most jobs. <br> <br>
                              Salery <br>
                              The salary of a gameplay programmer will vary greatly depending on the experience of the employee and the size of the studio. Large studios will likely be having a higher
                              starting salary as well as higher senior employee salary, from research it shows that senior can sometimes earn more than £100,000 however it is more likely to be around £65,000.
                              Starting salaries from junior programmers will usually be around £30,000 but will again vary greatly. For the benefits of employees it will be similar to that of a normal
                              job however bonuses based on the success of games will be common in most large to medium size studios. <br> <br>
                              Advice <br>
                              My advice for any gameplay programmer will be that the most import part is the love for games, this is due to passion and will to want to make a good game will be very important.
                              Despite this the industry is know for being demanding of employees and require full commitment to the company especially as deadlines approach however this will come with a
                              good salary and likely better benefits than a regular job. I would advice anyone interested in a job to make sure they fully understand the company they are applying for
                              and know that you will be able to meet the requirements of the job.
